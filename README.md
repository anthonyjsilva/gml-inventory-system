GML-INVENTORY-SYSTEM

- A set of functions to create an inventory system for Game Maker Studio 2 written in GML
- Feel free to use however you wish!
- created by Anthony Silva AKA "Burning Eyece"

---

NOTES
- our concept of an "inventory" will be an array of objects where each object represents an item slot
    - i.e. [ { id: 2, amt: 10 }, { id: 4, amt: 1 }, ... ]

- "inv" stands for "inventory"

- this could probably be written as an inventory Class instead with methods instead of all these functions
